System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe version 8 uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems. Accordingly, all of the components can also be installed on one server in the case of smaller installations or test environments.

The IT Security Act, which came into force in July 2015, is intended to form a blueprint for this purpose, and to ensure the leading position of Germany in the fight against digital threats. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which is also responsible for the ISO 27001 Certification based on the IT Baseline Protection Catalogues, has been setting the course for this. At the European level, too, the potential danger is taken into account by the Directive on Network and Information Security (NIS) , the counterpart to the German IT security law. Through the EU-wide strengthening of resistance to risks from the Internet, such criminal energies should be further restricted. Hazards and risks \u2693\ufe0e This is to be assessed as a reaction to a hazard, which could not be more concrete: The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation has estimated the number of digital attacks on German companies at 300,000 a day. According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the federal networks are targeted over a million times a year by hackers with financial interest, by politically motivated \u201chacktivists\u201d and, of course, by secret services.
