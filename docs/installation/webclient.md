# Installation WebClient

!!! danger "Hint"
    This guide focuses on the initial installation of the WebClient and is not relevant for further updates.

## Preparations for installation

### System requirements

 Please ensured that all [system requirements](requirements/webserver.md) have been met.

 ### SSL certificate

 When the web service is started, the certificate created in the basic configuration is configured and connected to port 11016. This is the connection certificate for communication between the web server and the Password Safe server.

### Databases

All databases that are to be used on the WebClient must be enabled for this purpose. With a double click on the corresponding database the option "Access via WebClient" can be activated.

## Installation

The WebClient is generated by the AdminClient and made available in a ZIP archive. Depending on the web server, the ZIP archive is created accordingly. The installation also differs depending on the web server used. Irrespective of the web server used, the following information firstly needs to be entered:

The next step is to define the location. The suggested location can be retained.

If you want to use {{about.product}} as an identity provider [SAML Service](/saml) must be selected. Otherwise, it will not be installed.
