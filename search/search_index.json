System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe version 8 uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments.

Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function.

The various configurations are briefly explained here. Service user \u2693\ufe0e The service user runs the Password Safe server service. The following can be configured here: AD user: It is specified in the format Domain\\username along with its associated password Local user: It is specified in the format .\\user name along with its associated password Local system account: It can be activated via a checkbox - not recommended in production environments! Be aware Certificates are generated during installation and usage. Therefore, the service user must be a local administrator or a domain administrator, otherwise it would have no rights to save data in the local server certificate store. Backup service user \u2693\ufe0e In principle, the backup service is run by the service user. In expert mode, however, it may be another user. A backup service user has the same requirements as a service user. User for the SQL configuration instance \u2693\ufe0e The user for the SQL configuration instance logs on to the SQL server to create the Password Safe databases. You can use an AD user or a local SQL user for this purpose. The following options are available: Service user: If the checkbox is activated, the stored service user is used. Please note that this can only be configured via the checkbox. It is not possible to manually set up the service user again. SQL user: An SQL user may also be used.
