Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it! The boundaries between the two often overlap, and can be freely defined in Password Safe.","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#permission-concept-and-protective-mechanisms","text":"","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#what-is-the-permission-concept","text":"With Password Safe version 8 we provide the right solution to all conceivable demands placed on it with regards to permission management.

Permissions are granted to these structures as usual via the ribbon. Further information on this subject can be found in the section \u201cPermissions for organisational structures\u201d . As a specific authorization concept is generally already used within organizational structures, this is also used as the basis for further permissions. This form of inheritance is technically equivalent to granting permissions based on affiliations to a folder . When creating a new record, the record receives the permissions in accordance with the defined permissions for the organizational unit. Relevant user settings \u2693\ufe0e Whether this form of inheritance should be applied is defined via the settings in the ribbon. It can be configured in more detail using two settings. Be Aware If a predefined rights exists, this will always overwrite inherited permissions from organizational structures Inherit permissions for new objects (without rights template) This setting is relevant for newly created records. The following values can be configured: Off: Permissions from OUs are not inherited Organizational unit: When creating new objects, permissions are set in accordance with the defined rights for the target organizational unit. This setting is active by default. Organizational unit and user: As well as inheriting permissions for organization units, the configured permissions for the user are now also inherited when creating private records. *If inheritance for the users is also activated, the creation of private records is in itself no longer possible. When creating new records to be saved in the organizational unit for the logged-in user, the permissions for the record are now granted in accordance with the permissions for the user. Existing passwords inherit changes to the permissions for organizational units This option means that changes to permissions for an organizational unit will be inherited by all passwords for this organizational unit. This setting is active by default. When inheriting permissions, a dialogue will be displayed that offers you the following options: Increase or reduce permissions: The permissions for the passwords are retained and are only increased or reduced by the change. Overwrite permissions: The permissions for the passwords are completely overwritten. This means that all permissions for a password are firstly removed and then the new permissions for the organizational unit are inherited. Cancel inheritance: The permissions are not inherited but are only changed in the organizational unit. *The permissions are only inherited by existing passwords within the organizational unit. Therefore, the permissions are not inherited downwards throughout the entire structure. Example case This example shows the creation of a new record in the organizational structure \u201cmarketing\u201d. It is defined in the settings for the stated organizational structure that permissions should be inherited by new objects in accordance with the organizational structure. The permissions for the organizational unit \u201cmarketing\u201d are shown below: A new password is now created in the organizational unit \u201cmarketing\u201d. It is important that no preset is defined for this organizational unit. The permissions for the record just created are now shown.

The following values can be configured: Off: Permissions from OUs are not inherited Organizational unit: When creating new objects, permissions are set in accordance with the defined rights for the target organizational unit. This setting is active by default. Organizational unit and user: As well as inheriting permissions for organization units, the configured permissions for the user are now also inherited when creating private records. *If inheritance for the users is also activated, the creation of private records is in itself no longer possible. When creating new records to be saved in the organizational unit for the logged-in user, the permissions for the record are now granted in accordance with the permissions for the user. Existing passwords inherit changes to the permissions for organizational units This option means that changes to permissions for an organizational unit will be inherited by all passwords for this organizational unit. This setting is active by default. When inheriting permissions, a dialogue will be displayed that offers you the following options: Increase or reduce permissions: The permissions for the passwords are retained and are only increased or reduced by the change. Overwrite permissions: The permissions for the passwords are completely overwritten. This means that all permissions for a password are firstly removed and then the new permissions for the organizational unit are inherited. Cancel inheritance: The permissions are not inherited but are only changed in the organizational unit. *The permissions are only inherited by existing passwords within the organizational unit. Therefore, the permissions are not inherited downwards throughout the entire structure. Example case This example shows the creation of a new record in the organizational structure \u201cmarketing\u201d. It is defined in the settings for the stated organizational structure that permissions should be inherited by new objects in accordance with the organizational structure. The permissions for the organizational unit \u201cmarketing\u201d are shown below: A new password is now created in the organizational unit \u201cmarketing\u201d. It is important that no preset is defined for this organizational unit. The permissions for the record just created are now shown. Conclusion The permissions for the \u201cstorage location\u201d are simply used when creating new objects. Two conditions apply here: The value \u201corganizational unit\u201d must be selected in the settings for the inheritance of permissions There must be no predefined right for the affected organizational structure This process is illustrated in the following diagram:","title":"Relevant user settings"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/manual_permissions/","text":"Manual setting of permissions \u2693\ufe0e What is the manual setting of permissions for records? \u2693\ufe0e In contrast to the automatic setting of permissions , the manual approach does not utilize any automatic processes. This method of setting permissions is thus carried out separately for every record \u2013 this process is not as recommended for newly created data. If you want to work effectively in the long term, the automatic setting of permissions should be used. However, the manual setting of permissions is generally used when editing already existing records. Adding additional users with permissions \u2693\ufe0e In the previous section, it was clarified that permissions are granted either directly to the user or to several users grouped in a role. With this knowledge, the permissions can be set manually. In the \"Passwords\" module , there are three different ways to access the permissions in the list view: Icon in the ribbon Context menu of a data record (right-click) Icon at the right edge of the reading pane Note The icon on the right of the reading pane shows the information whether the record is personal or public. In case of personal data records, the user that is logged on is the only one who has permissions! The author is created with all permissions for the record. As described in the Permission Concept , you can now add roles and users. 'Right click - Add' inside the userlist or use the ribbon \"User and roles\" to add a user. The filter helps you to quickly find those users who should be granted permissions for the record in just a few steps. The search filter opens in a separate tab and can be configured as usual.

The \u201cRead\u201d permission at the beginning is sufficient to view the fields of the data record and to use the password. \"Write\" permission allows you to edit a data record. The permission \u201cAuthorize\u201d is necessary to authorize other users to the record . This is also a requirement for the configuration of a seal . Transferring permissions \u2693\ufe0e A simple right-click on a user can be used to copy and transfer permission configurations of users or roles to others in the context menu. In this context, the use of permission templates is also very practical. In the \u201cTemplate\u201d area of \u200b\u200bthe ribbon, you can save configured permissions, including all users, and reuse them for other records. The transfer of permissions and their reuse can be an important building block to create and maintain entitlement integrity.

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems. Accordingly, all of the components can also be installed on one server in the case of smaller installations or test environments.

Otherwise, the packets to be transmitted are fragmented, which can lead to a significant performance loss. Required users \u2693\ufe0e A user via which the Password Safe server can log in to the SQL server is required for configuration. A user who can execute the Password Safe services is also required. The various configurations are briefly explained here. Service user \u2693\ufe0e The service user runs the Password Safe server service. The following can be configured here: AD user: It is specified in the format Domain\\username along with its associated password Local user: It is specified in the format .\\user name along with its associated password Local system account: It can be activated via a checkbox - not recommended in production environments! Be aware Certificates are generated during installation and usage. Therefore, the service user must be a local administrator or a domain administrator, otherwise it would have no rights to save data in the local server certificate store. Backup service user \u2693\ufe0e In principle, the backup service is run by the service user. In expert mode, however, it may be another user. A backup service user has the same requirements as a service user. User for the SQL configuration instance \u2693\ufe0e The user for the SQL configuration instance logs on to the SQL server to create the Password Safe databases. You can use an AD user or a local SQL user for this purpose. The following options are available: Service user: If the checkbox is activated, the stored service user is used. Please note that this can only be configured via the checkbox. It is not possible to manually set up the service user again. SQL user: An SQL user may also be used. It is saved on the SQL server according to the configuration. Note If the Password Safe server is to be used to create databases, the user needs dbCreator rights. Alternatively, the databases can be created directly by the SQL server. The Password Safe server will manage them. In this case, dbOwner rights are sufficient. See MSSQL requirements Configuration examples \u2693\ufe0e Option 1: A service user is created in the AD. It will be added as a service user, which can start both the Password Safe server service and the backup service. This user requires rights to start services. This user is then used for the SQL configuration instance (by activating the check box). Option 2: A local user is used as a service user. Specify a local SQL user, secured with a password, as a user for the SQL configuration instance. This could be the default sa user, for example. Be aware It is not possible to combine local system and service users for the SQL configuration instance! PowerShell permissions \u2693\ufe0e In Password Safe V8, Windows PowerShell scripts are used in several places. These are required, for example, to use the certificate-protected server key or to create the server certificate. Password Reset also uses this functionality. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the Windows security policy allows PowerShell scripts to be executed. Set policy \u2693\ufe0e Open the PowerShell console. Enter Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned and confirm. Verify policy \u2693\ufe0e The changed policy can be verified via Get-ExecutionPolicy -list .","title":"Application server"},{"location":"installation/requirements/server/#application-server","text":"","title":"Application server"},{"location":"installation/requirements/server/#server-configuration","text":"The business logic is managed by the application server.

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates. Since a new client cannot connect to an old server, this results in the user not being able to log in. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e The requirements should be checked or established before an update. Be aware Please always check the Changelog for requirements or breaking changes before updating! Check the software maintenance package \u2693\ufe0e The right to install updates is acquired with the software maintenance package. It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active. If the software maintenance package has expired, you are only permitted to use those versions that were released during the term of the software maintenance package. Therefore, you should check whether the software maintenance package is still active before an update. This can be easily checked on the AdminClient under License settings . Creating a backup \u2693\ufe0e An update always involves making a profound change to the existing software. A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information. Danger If the password for logging in to the AdminClient on the database has been saved, it is essential that it is noted down or temporarily saved elsewhere before an update! Latest installation files \u2693\ufe0e The installation files can be downloaded from the customer information system . Please simply use the access data that we sent to you by email to log in. Perform update \u2693\ufe0e Updating the AdminClient \u2693\ufe0e The AdminClient is simply installed on top of the existing installation. The password from the Admin Client should be made available at this point in any case. After the installation of the Admin Client, the database is only accessible when it is activated. If the password is only in the Password Safe, it should be temporarily stored at this point. Hint If the service has not been ended in advance, the installation wizard will give you the opportunity to do so. If the service is still not ended at this stage, the computer will then need to be restarted. It is thus recommended that the Password Safe services are ended before the update. Further information on the installation wizard can be found in the section Installation of the AdminClient . Patch level update for the databases \u2693\ufe0e The databases are usually deactivated after updating the AdminClient because they do not yet have the corresponding patch level. This should be immediately checked. After logging in to the AdminClient, the module \u201cDatabases\u201d is immediately visible. If the databases have been deactivated, you can reactivate them directly in the ribbon via the corresponding button. The patch level will be updated during this process. Updating the client \u2693\ufe0e The updates for the client are also simply installed over the existing installation. Further information can be found in the section Installation of the client. Naturally, the update can also be carried out using the installation parameters. Updating the WebClient \u2693\ufe0e The application server must firstly be updated. A new WebClient is then created according to the instructions for the web server being used. The document directory on the web server should now be completely emptied. The WebClient is then unzipped and copied to the document directory on the corresponding web server. Be aware If the WebClient is being operated on an IIS web server, a new config.bat is generated for creating the new version. This must not be executed if the WebClient has already been installed and it must be deleted without fail after a successful update. Hint If the WebClient is used, the module: proxy_wstunnel must be installed when using Apache. With IIS the WebSocket Protocol becomes necessary.
