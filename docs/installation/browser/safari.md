### Installing the add-on

The Safari Add-on can be downloaded from the following link:
[Password Safe Add-on for Safari](https://mateso.co/PS8ADDONSAFARI){target=_blank}.

To install it, simply double-click on the downloaded file. A window will open where you then only need to drag and drop the Password Safe logo onto the applications.
