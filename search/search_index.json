You can search for passwords in the add-on, transfer them to the clipboard or enter them in the input mask of the website automatically. The automatic login may require applications. In order to provide the data, the add-on needs a connection to the database. This can be set up in two ways, either via the \"SSO Agent\" or directly in server mode.

The following picture explains the exact procedure for connecting in detail: After successful connection, the number of data records available for the current Internet page is displayed on the icon. Database profiles \u2693\ufe0e The server mode must know which database profile it is connected to. There are two ways of setting up a database profile: First, the database profile can be created manually. Therefore, he following information is required: IP address, WebClient URL and database name. Please note that /api is appended to the end of the IP address. It is also possible that the database profile is filled out automatically. For this, you need to log on to a database via WebClient. By clicking on the add-on in the WebClient, its profile can be taken over. Now all necessary information such as profile name, IP address, WebClient and database name are transferred. The server mode benefits \u2693\ufe0e The server mode offers the following advantages: No terminal service is required in terminal server operation SSO Agent is no longer required Be aware Please note that SSO applications only work via SSO agent. If you are in server mode and the SSO agent has not been started, SSO applications do not work! Settings \u2693\ufe0e All settings that relate to the add-on are made centrally on the client. The user settings system can be used to enter them globally per organisational unit or per user. The following options have a direct impact on the add-ons and can be found in the SSO category: Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks ensures that the login is automatically completed after the access data has been entered. It is thus not necessary to click the relevant button manually About browser add-ons: Automatically fill login masks ensures that access data is entered without the need for any confirmation when a website is recognised. The default browser option also has an impact on the add-ons. This setting defines the browser in which the websites are opened from the client. Note It is important to note that the login mask for records with password masking will be \u201dsent automatically*, even if the setting Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks has been deactivated. Working with add-ons \u2693\ufe0e Note A record can only be used for entering data if it has a form field of type \"URL\".

To enable the uniform and secure storage of data other than passwords, Password Safe version 8 offers effective tools for the professional handling of sensitive documents and files. The ability to share documents with others according to their permissions gives you access to the current status of a document and helps avoid redundancies. The documents module is complemented by a sophisticated version management system, which records all versions of a document that were saved in the past and thus enables you to revert back to historical versions. The configuration of visibility is explained in a similar way to the other modules in one place.. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add new documents. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add new documents Adding documents \u2693\ufe0e There are two ways to manage documents and files in Password Safe v8: Creating a link : In this case, only a file that is located locally or on a network drive will be linked. The file itself is not stored in the database. Neither version management nor the traceability of changes in the history are possible. Storing the document in the database : The file becomes part of the encrypted database. It is saved within the database and can be made available selectively to employees for further processing in the future based on their permissions. Document selection \u2693\ufe0e When selecting the file to be uploaded, you can either browse your file system via the Explorer view or add objects by drag & drop. The latter gives you the possibility to directly import several documents in one step. Versioning \u2693\ufe0e The heart of each document management system is the ability to capture and archive changes to documents or files. All versions of a document can be compared with each other and historical versions can be restored if necessary. Password Safe provides this functionality via the history in the ribbon, as well as in the footer area for \u200b\u200bthe detailed view of a document. This can be used in the same way as the password history . The interplay between the document-specific event logbook and the history provides a complete list of all information that is relevant to the handling of sensitive data. Version management can be used to restore any historical versions of a document. Hint The file size for a linked document can only be updated if the document was opened using Password Safe.

Differences to the LDAP connection \u2693\ufe0e The connection to the Azure AD differs in one special point from the connection to a conventional Active Directory. While Password Safe queries the users, groups, and roles actively from the conventional AD, the Azure AD is pushing them automatically to our server. For this a so-called SCIM service is used. To login to Password Safe, after entering the username a popup opens for the authentication with the entered Microsoft account. Here, a possible configured second factor is also requested. The authentication is handled via the Open ID Connect protocol. Linking Azure AD \u2693\ufe0e Below you will find instructions on how to connect Azure AD to Password Safe.

The advantage offered by end-to-end encryption is that Active Directory is \u201cdefused\u201d as a possible insecure gateway. In Master Key mode, users who control Active Directory receive de facto complete access to all passwords because resetting a Windows user name enables users to log in under another person\u2019s name.

Active Directory objects \u2693\ufe0e In the next step, select the relevant profile that should be used for the import. Then, select the organizational units and/or users for the import. A search is available for this purpose. It can be seen that the organizational units Jupiter and Contoso contain items to be imported. The organizational units themselves will not be imported. The check next to the group Accounting indicates that the group itself will be imported along with some of its sub-elements. There are different symbols which indicate the elements to be imported. The element itself and all possible sub-elements will be imported The element itself and some of its sub-elements will be imported The element will not be imported; however, it contains elements that will be imported A context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button is available within the list that provides helpful functions for selecting the individual elements. Select sub-objects selects all sub-objects that are located directly below the current object Deselect sub-objects removes tags from all sub-objects that are located directly below the current object Reset all items removes all previously set tags Display element details lists all information that is available for the current element In the lower area you can specify whether the users just selected for import should be created as Light or Full users. Hint If individual users, organizational units, or roles cannot be selected for import, they have already been imported via another profile Summary \u2693\ufe0e The last page summarizes which objects will be edited and in what form.

The individual elements then appear in the list one by one. This may take some time, depending on the amount of import data. If the import is terminated, you will receive a confirmation. Hint As end-to-end encryption is retained in this mode, the server does not receive a key to match already imported users with the AD. There is thus no synchronization with the AD. Similarly, no memberships can be imported. After the import, users must be manually assigned to the appropriate organizational units and roles. Imported users and organizational units \u2693\ufe0e In end-to-end mode, the imported users behave like local users. The users can/must be edited manually in Password Safe. The affiliations to organizational units and/or roles must be adapted manually. Rights \u2693\ufe0e The rights will be issued as follows during the import or synchronization. New objects \u2693\ufe0e User Groups Roles Are rights inherited from the OU? If no preset has been saved If no preset has been saved No Are rights applied from a preset?

None None None Hint In end-to-end mode, no role affiliations are issued during the import or synchronization.

This may take some time, depending on the amount of import data. If the import was terminated, this is symbolized by a hint. Imported users and organizational units \u2693\ufe0e The users and organizational units imported in Masterkey mode cannot be edited in Password Safe. Therefore, any changes must be made in AD and synchronized. AD thus becomes the leading system. Affiliations to roles are also synchronized and must be set in the AD. In organizational units or roles created in Password Safe, the users can be included directly in Password Safe. Rights \u2693\ufe0e The rights will be issued as follows during the import or synchronization. New objects \u2693\ufe0e User Groups Roles Are rights inherited from the OU?

All with the \"authorize\" right None All with the \"authorize\" right Hint If a user is imported, he will be given those roles that he also had in AD insofar as these roles already exist in Password Safe or have also been imported. Logging into Password Safe \u2693\ufe0e Users who are imported using this mode can log in with the domain password. Please note that no domain needs to be specified when logging in. Of course, the login process can also be supplemented with multifactor authentication . Hint Logging on using Kerberos works \"automatically\". As long as the corresponding Kerberos server is accessible, the users in the domain authenticate themselves via Kerberos using their domain password. If the logon via Kerberos does not work \u2013 e.g. due to incorrect configuration of the domain controller \u2013 the logon via the NTLM protocol is attempted. However, these are all settings that have to be made on the domain controller and have nothing to do with Password Safe. Be Aware Logging on to Password Safe using SSO via Kerberos is currently not possible. Permissions to imported objects \u2693\ufe0e The rights to be issued to imported users are explained in the following example: In Master Key mode, all users will be issued with the read right. The responsible user will be issued with all rights and the key. This ensures that he can also synchronize or change the user in the future Other responsible users are issued with the same rights as the responsible user The Master Key for the Active Directory profile will also be issued with all rights and keys as it will be used for the synchronization Finally, users will be issued with the rights for themselves Hint All users and roles issued with rights to the imported object also receive its rights key. Synchronization \u2693\ufe0e During synchronization, all relevant information for users, organizational units and roles (names, email, etc.) is updated. Changed affiliations for roles are adjusted. Likewise, users are activated or deactivated according to the settings in the AD. If the membership of organizational units is to be changed, this can be done by Drag & Drop . New users and correspondingly defined roles are imported. Hint If the tick was not set in the Synchronization column when a user is imported, no changes are made. Manual synchronization \u2693\ufe0e The synchronization can be started manually at any time via the corresponding button in the ribbon. Select the required profile and start the synchronization. As is the case with the initial import, the synchronization runs in the background. A hint indicates that the process has been completed. Synchronization via system tasks \u2693\ufe0e The synchronization can also be carried out automatically. This is made possible via the system tasks . Deleting or removing users \u2693\ufe0e If a user is deleted in Active Directory, it is also deleted in Password Safe during the next synchronization. For this purpose, it is necessary for the user to be imported as a synchronizable user. If the user is only deleted from Password Safe but retained in Active Directory, a synchronization needs to be carried out to delete it from the database. For this purpose, the wizard is called up via import . The first step is to select an organizational unit. This has no effect when simply deleting a user. The second step is to search for the user.

In addition, there are two mechanisms that directly build on the permissions for organizational structures. Limiting visibility : It was already explained in the section on visibility that selectively withholding information is a very effective protective mechanism . Configuration of the visibility is carried out directly when issuing permissions to organizational structures . Inheriting permissions for records : Inheritance from organizational structures is defined as a system standard. This means that there is no difference between the permissions for an organizational structure and the permissions for data that is stored in these organizational structures. he way in which permissions for organizational structures are designed thus effects the subsequent work with Password Safe in many ways. The following diagram describes the above-mentioned interfaces. Permissions \u2693\ufe0e The visibility and also inheritance mechanisms are not considered below. This section exclusively deals with permissions for the actual organizational structure. It deals with which users and roles have what form of permissions for a given organizational structure. Permissions for organizational structures can be defined via the ribbon or also the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button. A permissions tab appears: Hint The basic mechanisms for setting permissions is described in detail in the Authorization concept. Be Aware It is important that the permissions displayed here are interpreted correctly! The example above shows the permissions for the \"organizational structure IT\". The user Max Muster possesses all rights to the organizational structure IT and can thus edit, delete and also grant permissions for this structure. The add right \u2693\ufe0e The \"add\" right holds a special position amongst the available rights because it does not refer to the organizational unit itself but rather to data that will be created within it. In general, it is fair to say that to add objects in an organizational unit requires the add right.

The Passwords module provides administrators and users with central access to the passwords for the purpose of handling this sensitive data that requires protection. Search filters in combination with color-highlighted tags enable very focussed work. Various approaches can be used to help apply the desired permissions to objects. Furthermore, the ergonomic structure of the module helps all users to use Password Safe in an efficient and targeted manner. Prerequisite \u2693\ufe0e The following user right is required for adding new passwords: Can add new passwords Module-specific ribbon functions \u2693\ufe0e The ribbon offers access to all possible actions relevant to the situation at all times. Especially within the \"Passwords\" module, the ribbon plays a key role due to the numerous module-specific functions. General information on the subject of the ribbon is available in the relevant section. The module-specific ribbon functions will be explained below. New \u2693\ufe0e New password : New passwords can be added via this icon in the ribbon, via the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button and via the shortcut (Ctrl + N). The next step is to select a suitable form . Open : Opens the object marked in list view and provides further information about the record in the reading pane . Delete : Deletes the object marked in list view . A log file entry is created (see logbook ). Reveal : The function Reveal can be used for all records that have a password field. The passwords in the reading pane will be revealed. In the example, the passwords have been revealed and can be hidden again with the Hide button. Actions \u2693\ufe0e Notifications : Defining notifications enables a constant flow of information about any type of interaction. The issuing of notifications is carried out in the module designed for this purpose. Duplicate : Duplicating creates an exact copy of the record in a new tab. Move : Moves the record marked in list view to another organizational structure. Favorite : The selected record is marked as a favorite. It is possible to switch between all records and favorites at any time. Quick view : A modal window opens for the selected record for 15 seconds and displays all available information including the value of the password . Change form : It is possible to change the form used for individual records. \"Mapping\" of the previous form fields can be directly carried out in the process. Permissions \u2693\ufe0e Permissions : The drop-down menu can be used to set both password permissions and also form field permissions. This method only allows the manual setting of permissions for data (see authorization concept ). Password masking : Masking passwords that need to be protected from unauthorized users is an important feature of the security concept in Password Safe. Seal : The multi-eye principle in Password Safe is covered in its own section. Seals . Clipboard \u2693\ufe0e The clipboard is a key element in the ribbon. This only exists in the \"Passwords\" module. Clicking on the desired form field for a record in the ribbon will copy it to the clipboard. The message in the style of the \"Balloon Tips\" in Windows shows that the password has now been saved in the clipboard for 300 seconds. (Note: the time until the clipboard is cleared is 60 seconds by default. In the present case, this has been adjusted via the user settings.) Start \u2693\ufe0e Conveniently working with passwords is only possible via the efficient usage of automated accesses via RDP, SSH, general Windows applications or websites. This makes it possible to dispense with (unsecure) entries via \"copy & paste\". Open web page : If an URL is saved in the record, this menu option can be used to directly open it. Applications : If applications have been linked to records, they can be directly opened via the \"start menu\". Extras \u2693\ufe0e Create external link : This option creates an external link for the record marked in list view. A number of different options can be selected: Be Aware If several sessions are opened on a client, an external link is always called in the first session. History : This icon opens the history for those records selected in list view in a new tab. Due to the comprehensive recording of historical versions of passwords, it is now possible to compare several versions with one another. Print : This option can be used to open the print function. Export : It is possible to export all the selected records and also the data defined by the filter to a .csv file. Change form : This option can be used to assign a new form to the selected passwords. Settings : The password settings are described in a separate section. Hint The password module is based on the module of the same name in the WebClient. Both modules have a different scope and design.

Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it! The boundaries between the two often overlap, and can be freely defined in Password Safe.","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#permission-concept-and-protective-mechanisms","text":"","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#what-is-the-permission-concept","text":"With Password Safe version 8 we provide the right solution to all conceivable demands placed on it with regards to permission management.

This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales.

Nevertheless, this aspect of the visibility of the records is closely interwoven with the existing permissions structure. Naturally, a user can always only see those records for which they have at least a read Permission . This doctrine should always be taken into consideration when handling records. Tags are not subject to any permissions and can thus always be used as filter criteria. Nevertheless, the delivered results will only contain those records for which the user themselves actually has permissions. A good example here is the tag \u201cpersonal record\u201d. Every user can mark their own record as personal \u2013 yet each user will naturally only be able to find their own personal records. Creating independently working environments \u2693\ufe0e The possibility of separately defining the visibility of individual objects is one of the special features within the Password Safe authorization concept. Irrespective of whether handling records, documents, organizational structures, roles or forms: it is always possible to define whether a user or a role possesses a read permission to the object or not. The permissions for each of these objects can be defined separately via the ribbon in the permissions dialogue. This approach enables the creation of independently existing departments within a database. The permissions structure for the SAP form can be seen below. It shows that only the sales manager and the administrators are currently permitted to create new records of type SAP.

Nevertheless, this aspect of the visibility of the records is closely interwoven with the existing permissions structure. Naturally, a user can always only see those records for which they have at least a read Permission . This doctrine should always be taken into consideration when handling records. Tags are not subject to any permissions and can thus always be used as filter criteria. Nevertheless, the delivered results will only contain those records for which the user themselves actually has permissions. A good example here is the tag \u201cpersonal record\u201d. Every user can mark their own record as personal \u2013 yet each user will naturally only be able to find their own personal records.","title":"Visibility of data"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/protective_mechanisms/visibility/#creating-independently-working-environments","text":"The possibility of separately defining the visibility of individual objects is one of the special features within the Password Safe authorization concept. Irrespective of whether handling records, documents, organizational structures, roles or forms: it is always possible to define whether a user or a role possesses a read permission to the object or not. The permissions for each of these objects can be defined separately via the ribbon in the permissions dialogue. This approach enables the creation of independently existing departments within a database. The permissions structure for the SAP form can be seen below. It shows that only the sales manager and the administrators are currently permitted to create new records of type SAP.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template. Seal templates can be optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview. Summary \u2693\ufe0e The permissions already present on the data set form the basis for any complex seal configurations.

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic.

The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments.

Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

The installation also differs depending on the web server used. Irrespective of the web server used, the following information firstly needs to be entered: Destination \u2693\ufe0e Name the folder where the ZIP archive with the WebClient should be placed. Danger Do not use the AdminClient installation directory! Hint If the web server is created on IIS, execute config.bat to handle integration of the web server.
