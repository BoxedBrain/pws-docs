System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe version 8 uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates. Since a new client cannot connect to an old server, this results in the user not being able to log in. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e The requirements should be checked or established before an update. Be aware Please always check the Changelog for requirements or breaking changes before updating! Check the software maintenance package \u2693\ufe0e The right to install updates is acquired with the software maintenance package. It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active. If the software maintenance package has expired, you are only permitted to use those versions that were released during the term of the software maintenance package. Therefore, you should check whether the software maintenance package is still active before an update. This can be easily checked on the AdminClient under License settings . Creating a backup \u2693\ufe0e An update always involves making a profound change to the existing software. A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information. Danger If the password for logging in to the AdminClient on the database has been saved, it is essential that it is noted down or temporarily saved elsewhere before an update! Latest installation files \u2693\ufe0e The installation files can be downloaded from the customer information system . Please simply use the access data that we sent to you by email to log in. Perform update \u2693\ufe0e Updating the AdminClient \u2693\ufe0e The AdminClient is simply installed on top of the existing installation. The password from the Admin Client should be made available at this point in any case. After the installation of the Admin Client, the database is only accessible when it is activated. If the password is only in the password safe, it should be temporarily stored at this point. Hint If the service has not been ended in advance, the installation wizard will give you the opportunity to do so. If the service is still not ended at this stage, the computer will then need to be restarted. It is thus recommended that the Password Safe services are ended before the update. Further information on the installation wizard can be found in the section Installation of the AdminClient . Patch level update for the databases \u2693\ufe0e The databases are usually deactivated after updating the AdminClient because they do not yet have the corresponding patch level. This should be immediately checked. After logging in to the AdminClient, the module \u201cDatabases\u201d is immediately visible. If the databases have been deactivated, you can reactivate them directly in the ribbon via the corresponding button. The patch level will be updated during this process. Updating the client \u2693\ufe0e The updates for the client are also simply installed over the existing installation. Further information can be found in the section Installation of the client.
