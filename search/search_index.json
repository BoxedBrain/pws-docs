You can search for passwords in the add-on, transfer them to the clipboard or enter them in the input mask of the website automatically. The automatic login may require applications. In order to provide the data, the add-on needs a connection to the database. This can be set up in two ways, either via the \"SSO Agent\" or directly in server mode.

The following picture explains the exact procedure for connecting in detail: After successful connection, the number of data records available for the current Internet page is displayed on the icon. Database profiles \u2693\ufe0e The server mode must know which database profile it is connected to. There are two ways of setting up a database profile: First, the database profile can be created manually. Therefore, he following information is required: IP address, WebClient URL and database name. Please note that /api is appended to the end of the IP address. It is also possible that the database profile is filled out automatically. For this, you need to log on to a database via WebClient. By clicking on the add-on in the WebClient, its profile can be taken over. Now all necessary information such as profile name, IP address, WebClient and database name are transferred. The server mode benefits \u2693\ufe0e The server mode offers the following advantages: No terminal service is required in terminal server operation SSO Agent is no longer required Be aware Please note that SSO applications only work via SSO agent. If you are in server mode and the SSO agent has not been started, SSO applications do not work! Settings \u2693\ufe0e All settings that relate to the add-on are made centrally on the client. The user settings system can be used to enter them globally per organisational unit or per user. The following options have a direct impact on the add-ons and can be found in the SSO category: Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks ensures that the login is automatically completed after the access data has been entered. It is thus not necessary to click the relevant button manually About browser add-ons: Automatically fill login masks ensures that access data is entered without the need for any confirmation when a website is recognised. The default browser option also has an impact on the add-ons. This setting defines the browser in which the websites are opened from the client. Note It is important to note that the login mask for records with password masking will be \u201dsent automatically*, even if the setting Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks has been deactivated. Working with add-ons \u2693\ufe0e Note A record can only be used for entering data if it has a form field of type \"URL\".

To enable the uniform and secure storage of data other than passwords, Password Safe version 8 offers effective tools for the professional handling of sensitive documents and files. The ability to share documents with others according to their permissions gives you access to the current status of a document and helps avoid redundancies. The documents module is complemented by a sophisticated version management system, which records all versions of a document that were saved in the past and thus enables you to revert back to historical versions. The configuration of visibility is explained in a similar way to the other modules in one place.. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add new documents. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add new documents Adding documents \u2693\ufe0e There are two ways to manage documents and files in Password Safe v8: Creating a link : In this case, only a file that is located locally or on a network drive will be linked. The file itself is not stored in the database. Neither version management nor the traceability of changes in the history are possible. Storing the document in the database : The file becomes part of the encrypted database. It is saved within the database and can be made available selectively to employees for further processing in the future based on their permissions. Document selection \u2693\ufe0e When selecting the file to be uploaded, you can either browse your file system via the Explorer view or add objects by drag & drop. The latter gives you the possibility to directly import several documents in one step. Versioning \u2693\ufe0e The heart of each document management system is the ability to capture and archive changes to documents or files. All versions of a document can be compared with each other and historical versions can be restored if necessary. Password Safe provides this functionality via the history in the ribbon, as well as in the footer area for \u200b\u200bthe detailed view of a document. This can be used in the same way as the password history . The interplay between the document-specific event logbook and the history provides a complete list of all information that is relevant to the handling of sensitive data. Version management can be used to restore any historical versions of a document. Hint The file size for a linked document can only be updated if the document was opened using Password Safe.

You can see the field assignment for the user name below using a login to an SQL server as an example. All of the other fields that should be automatically entered are assigned in the same way. The process is always the same. You select the field that needs to be automatically filled and then decide which information should be used to fill it.

In this example, the VMware vSphere Client has a total of 4 assigned fields: IP, user name, password and clicking the button to subsequently confirm the login. Graphical recognition: The graphical recognition function provides additional protection. It can be used to define other factors for the SSO.

Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it! The boundaries between the two often overlap, and can be freely defined in Password Safe.","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#permission-concept-and-protective-mechanisms","text":"","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#what-is-the-permission-concept","text":"With Password Safe version 8 we provide the right solution to all conceivable demands placed on it with regards to permission management.

This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales.

Nevertheless, this aspect of the visibility of the records is closely interwoven with the existing permissions structure. Naturally, a user can always only see those records for which they have at least a read Permission . This doctrine should always be taken into consideration when handling records. Tags are not subject to any permissions and can thus always be used as filter criteria. Nevertheless, the delivered results will only contain those records for which the user themselves actually has permissions. A good example here is the tag \u201cpersonal record\u201d. Every user can mark their own record as personal \u2013 yet each user will naturally only be able to find their own personal records. Creating independently working environments \u2693\ufe0e The possibility of separately defining the visibility of individual objects is one of the special features within the Password Safe authorization concept. Irrespective of whether handling records, documents, organizational structures, roles or forms: it is always possible to define whether a user or a role possesses a read permission to the object or not. The permissions for each of these objects can be defined separately via the ribbon in the permissions dialogue. This approach enables the creation of independently existing departments within a database. The permissions structure for the SAP form can be seen below. It shows that only the sales manager and the administrators are currently permitted to create new records of type SAP. In general, each department can independently use forms, create passwords and manage hierarchies in this way.

Nevertheless, this aspect of the visibility of the records is closely interwoven with the existing permissions structure. Naturally, a user can always only see those records for which they have at least a read Permission . This doctrine should always be taken into consideration when handling records. Tags are not subject to any permissions and can thus always be used as filter criteria. Nevertheless, the delivered results will only contain those records for which the user themselves actually has permissions. A good example here is the tag \u201cpersonal record\u201d. Every user can mark their own record as personal \u2013 yet each user will naturally only be able to find their own personal records.","title":"Visibility of data"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/protective_mechanisms/visibility/#creating-independently-working-environments","text":"The possibility of separately defining the visibility of individual objects is one of the special features within the Password Safe authorization concept. Irrespective of whether handling records, documents, organizational structures, roles or forms: it is always possible to define whether a user or a role possesses a read permission to the object or not. The permissions for each of these objects can be defined separately via the ribbon in the permissions dialogue. This approach enables the creation of independently existing departments within a database. The permissions structure for the SAP form can be seen below. It shows that only the sales manager and the administrators are currently permitted to create new records of type SAP. In general, each department can independently use forms, create passwords and manage hierarchies in this way.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template. Seal templates can be optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview. Summary \u2693\ufe0e The permissions already present on the data set form the basis for any complex seal configurations.

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic.

The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments.

Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

The installation also differs depending on the web server used. Irrespective of the web server used, the following information firstly needs to be entered: Destination \u2693\ufe0e Name the folder where the ZIP archive with the WebClient should be placed. Danger Do not use the AdminClient installation directory! Hint If the web server is created on IIS, execute config.bat to handle integration of the web server.
