The IT Security Act, which came into force in July 2015, is intended to form a blueprint for this purpose, and to ensure the leading position of Germany in the fight against digital threats. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which is also responsible for the ISO 27001 Certification based on the IT Baseline Protection Catalogues, has been setting the course for this. At the European level, too, the potential danger is taken into account by the Directive on Network and Information Security (NIS) , the counterpart to the German IT security law. Through the EU-wide strengthening of resistance to risks from the Internet, such criminal energies should be further restricted. Hazards and risks \u2693\ufe0e This is to be assessed as a reaction to a hazard, which could not be more concrete: The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation has estimated the number of digital attacks on German companies at 300,000 a day. According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the federal networks are targeted over a million times a year by hackers with financial interest, by politically motivated \u201chacktivists\u201d and, of course, by secret services. The BKA has been warning on the internet for years, both in the private sector and in the company environment. Acquired thieves in the form of security-critical corporate interiors are regularly subject to blackmail. Vulnerability of passwords \u2693\ufe0e Due to the rapid digital revolution, more and more focus is being placed on the topic of password security in particular. Passwords, which were still relatively safe 5 years ago, have to be put to the test again due to technical progress. Only randomly selected passwords with a corresponding number of digits can really defuse this problem. It is also important to ensure that these passwords are changed at predefined intervals. The solutions of the MATESO Password Safe \u2693\ufe0e The safest passwords are still those that can be completely hidden from the users. Automatic entries allow users to work efficiently without knowing their passwords. By means of the most advanced methods of the Password Reset, these access codes can also be reset automatically at intervals that can be as short as required. There are also safety mechanisms which link access to systems to a release by those users with the required permissions, according to the double-check principle. All these routines are backed up by highly complex encryption methods. Regular penetration tests ensure that the software is specifically tested by independent experts for weaknesses in architecture as well as the correct use of state-of-the-art cryptographic technologies.

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe version 8 uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments.

Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

A backup service user has the same requirements as a service user. User for the SQL configuration instance \u2693\ufe0e The user for the SQL configuration instance logs on to the SQL server to create the Password Safe databases. You can use an AD user or a local SQL user for this purpose. The following options are available: Service user: If the checkbox is activated, the stored service user is used. Please note that this can only be configured via the checkbox. It is not possible to manually set up the service user again. SQL user: An SQL user may also be used. It is saved on the SQL server according to the configuration. Note If the Password Safe server is to be used to create databases, the user needs dbCreator rights. Alternatively, the databases can be created directly by the SQL server. The Password Safe server will manage them. In this case, dbOwner rights are sufficient. See MSSQL requirements Configuration examples \u2693\ufe0e Option 1: A service user is created in the AD. It will be added as a service user, which can start both the Password Safe server service and the backup service. This user requires rights to start services. This user is then used for the SQL configuration instance (by activating the check box). Option 2: A local user is used as a service user. Specify a local SQL user, secured with a password, as a user for the SQL configuration instance. This could be the default sa user, for example. Be aware It is not possible to combine local system and service users for the SQL configuration instance! PowerShell permissions \u2693\ufe0e In Password Safe V8, Windows PowerShell scripts are used in several places. These are required, for example, to use the certificate-protected server key or to create the server certificate. Password Reset also uses this functionality. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the Windows security policy allows PowerShell scripts to be executed. Set policy \u2693\ufe0e Open the PowerShell console. Enter Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned and confirm.
