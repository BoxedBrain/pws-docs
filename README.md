# Password Safe Documentation

This is the official documentation page for Password Safe v8!  
  
Community improvements are encouraged! Just click the little pencil mark on the page you'd like to change and submit a pull request.  
Be aware, that the documentation uses [Markup Language](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

If you'd like to do more advanced changes (e.g. adding a page), the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) and a local test environment using this [docker-compose file](docker-compose.yml) is very helpful.  
You can start the local container using the following command:

``` bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --detach
```

Then browse the docs by visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
