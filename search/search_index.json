Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it! The boundaries between the two often overlap, and can be freely defined in Password Safe.","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#permission-concept-and-protective-mechanisms","text":"","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#what-is-the-permission-concept","text":"With Password Safe version 8 we provide the right solution to all conceivable demands placed on it with regards to permission management.

This method of setting permissions is thus carried out separately for every record \u2013 this process is not as recommended for newly created data. If you want to work effectively in the long term, the automatic setting of permissions should be used. However, the manual setting of permissions is generally used when editing already existing records. Adding additional users with permissions \u2693\ufe0e In the previous section, it was clarified that permissions are granted either directly to the user or to several users grouped in a role. With this knowledge, the permissions can be set manually. In the \"Passwords\" module , there are three different ways to access the permissions in the list view: Icon in the ribbon Context menu of a data record (right-click) Icon at the right edge of the reading pane Note The icon on the right of the reading pane shows the information whether the record is personal or public. In case of personal data records, the user that is logged on is the only one who has permissions! The author is created with all permissions for the record. As described in the Permission Concept , you can now add roles and users. 'Right click - Add' inside the userlist or use the ribbon \"User and roles\" to add a user. The filter helps you to quickly find those users who should be granted permissions for the record in just a few steps. The search filter opens in a separate tab and can be configured as usual. Multiple selection is also enabled. It allows to add several users via the Windows standard Ctrl/Shift + left mouse button. Set and remove permissions \u2693\ufe0e By default, all added users or roles receive only the \u201cRead\u201d permission on the record. The \u201cRead\u201d permission at the beginning is sufficient to view the fields of the data record and to use the password. \"Write\" permission allows you to edit a data record. The permission \u201cAuthorize\u201d is necessary to authorize other users to the record . This is also a requirement for the configuration of a seal . Transferring permissions \u2693\ufe0e A simple right-click on a user can be used to copy and transfer permission configurations of users or roles to others in the context menu. In this context, the use of permission templates is also very practical. In the \u201cTemplate\u201d area of \u200b\u200bthe ribbon, you can save configured permissions, including all users, and reuse them for other records.

Various mechanisms can be used to select the records to be edited. You are able to select the records in list view or you can use the filter as part of the multiple editing function. Both scenarios are described below. User permissions for batch processing \u2693\ufe0e This mode is inactive by default and needs to be activated in the user rights. Can carry out batch processing for permissions based on a filter Multiple editing via list view \u2693\ufe0e Individual permissions can be added or remove via Multiple editing within list view . The existing permissions will not be overwritten . Selecting the records \u2693\ufe0e In list view , Shift or Ctrl + mouse click can be used to select multiple records. Permissions can also be granted for these records via the selection. The marked records are displayed in a different color. 6 records are marked in the following image. Dialogue for configuring the permissions \u2693\ufe0e A new tab will be opened in the ribbon above the \"Permissions\" button in which the permissions can be configured. The tab will display the number of records that will be affected by the defined changes. Note As the already granted permissions for the selected records may differ, it is not possible to display the permissions here. Adding permissions \u2693\ufe0e To add a permission, a user or role is selected first in the ribbon under Search and add or Search . The permissions are then selected as usual in the ribbon. The symbol indicates that permissions will be added. In the following example, Mr. Steiner receives read permission to all selected records. In contrast, Mr. Brewery receives all permissions. Reducing permissions / removing users and roles from the permissions \u2693\ufe0e If you want to remove permissions, it is also necessary to add the user or the desired role to be edited. Clicking on Reduce permissions now means that permissions will be removed. This is indicated by the symbol. The selected permissions will be removed. Note If the read permission is to be removed for a user or role, the user will be completely removed from the permissions. Examples \u2693\ufe0e In the following example, Mr. Steiner receives read permissions to all selected records. In contrast, Mr. Brewery receives all permissions: The read permission will be removed for Mr. Steiner. As removing the read permissions means that no other permissions exist for the record, Mr. Steiner is completely removed from the permissions. The authorize, move, export and print permissions are being removed from Mr. Brewery. Assuming that he previously had all permissions, he will then have read, write and delete permissions remaining: Batch processing using a filter \u2693\ufe0e In some cases it is necessary to edit the permissions for a very large number of records. On the one hand, a maximum limit of 1000 records exists and on the other hand, handling a very large number of records via list view is not always the best solution. The Batch processing using a filter mode has been developed for this purpose. This is directly initiated via the ribbon. In the subsequent dialogue, you define whether you want to expand, reduce or completely overwrite existing permissions. If you select expand or reduce at this stage, the same logic as for editing via list view is used. No permissions will thus be overwritten. In the option overwrite permissions , the existing permissions are removed and then replaced by the newly defined permissions. Be Aware It is important to proceed with great caution when overwriting permissions because this function can quickly lead to a large number of records becoming unusable. The filter itself defines the selection criteria for the records to be edited. The currently configured filter will be used as default. The records that will be affected by the changes are also not displayed in this view. Only the number of records is displayed. In the following example, 9 passwords are being edited to add the read permission the role \u201cSales\u201d. Seals and password masking \u2693\ufe0e Sealed or masked records cannot be edited using batch processing. If these types of passwords are selected, a dialogue will be displayed when carrying out batch processing to inquire how these records should be handled. It is possible to select whether the affected records are skipped or whether the seal or password masking should be removed. If the remove option is selected, the process needs to be confirmed again by entering a PIN. Be Aware The removal of seals and password masking cannot be reversed! Note Depending on the number of records, editing records may take a long time. This process is carried out in the background for this reason. A hint will indicate that the permissions process has been completed.","title":"Multiple editing of permissions"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/manual_setting_of_permissions/multiple_permissions/#multiple-editing-of-permissions","text":"","title":"Multiple editing of permissions"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/manual_setting_of_permissions/multiple_permissions/#how-to-edit-multiple-permissions","text":"As part of the manual modification of permissions, it is also possible to edit multiple records at the same time.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template. Seal templates can be optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview.

In this way, the security of Password Safe and the data stored in it is tested in advance in order to be able to offer our customers effective protection and minimize the risk of success of an attack.","title":"Why we test regularly?"},{"location":"installation/","text":"Installation \u2693\ufe0e The following pages will provide you with all the information how to install the different Password Safe components. System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems. Accordingly, all of the components can also be installed on one server in the case of smaller installations or test environments.

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates. Since a new client cannot connect to an old server, this results in the user not being able to log in. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e The requirements should be checked or established before an update. Be aware Please always check the Changelog for requirements or breaking changes before updating! Check the software maintenance package \u2693\ufe0e The right to install updates is acquired with the software maintenance package. It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active. If the software maintenance package has expired, you are only permitted to use those versions that were released during the term of the software maintenance package. Therefore, you should check whether the software maintenance package is still active before an update. This can be easily checked on the AdminClient under License settings . Creating a backup \u2693\ufe0e An update always involves making a profound change to the existing software. A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information.

Perform update \u2693\ufe0e Updating the AdminClient \u2693\ufe0e The AdminClient is simply installed on top of the existing installation. The password from the Admin Client should be made available at this point in any case. After the installation of the Admin Client, the database is only accessible when it is activated. If the password is only in the Password Safe, it should be temporarily stored at this point. Hint If the service has not been ended in advance, the installation wizard will give you the opportunity to do so. If the service is still not ended at this stage, the computer will then need to be restarted. It is thus recommended that the Password Safe services are ended before the update. Further information on the installation wizard can be found in the section Installation of the AdminClient . Patch level update for the databases \u2693\ufe0e The databases are usually deactivated after updating the AdminClient because they do not yet have the corresponding patch level. This should be immediately checked. After logging in to the AdminClient, the module \u201cDatabases\u201d is immediately visible. If the databases have been deactivated, you can reactivate them directly in the ribbon via the corresponding button. The patch level will be updated during this process. Updating the client \u2693\ufe0e The updates for the client are also simply installed over the existing installation. Further information can be found in the section Installation of the client. Naturally, the update can also be carried out using the installation parameters. Updating the WebClient \u2693\ufe0e The application server must firstly be updated.

Be aware If the WebClient is being operated on an IIS web server, a new config.bat is generated for creating the new version. This must not be executed if the WebClient has already been installed and it must be deleted without fail after a successful update.
