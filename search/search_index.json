To enable the uniform and secure storage of data other than passwords, Password Safe version 8 offers effective tools for the professional handling of sensitive documents and files. The ability to share documents with others according to their permissions gives you access to the current status of a document and helps avoid redundancies.

The latter gives you the possibility to directly import several documents in one step. Versioning \u2693\ufe0e The heart of each document management system is the ability to capture and archive changes to documents or files. All versions of a document can be compared with each other and historical versions can be restored if necessary. Password Safe provides this functionality via the history in the ribbon, as well as in the footer area for \u200b\u200bthe detailed view of a document.

In this context, Forms represent templates for the information which have to be stored. The manageability of existing forms primarily ensures the completeness of the data which have to be stored. Nevertheless, their use as an effective filter criterion is not to be ignored! Forms have a lasting impact on working with Password Safe v8 and must be managed and maintained with the necessary care by the administration. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following options are required to add new forms. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add new forms Display form module Standard forms \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe is supplied with a series of standard forms \u2013 these should generally cover all standard requirements. Naturally, it is still possible to adapt the standard forms to your individual requirements. The associated preview for the form selected in list view appears in the reading pane . Both the field name and also the field type are visible. Creating new forms \u2693\ufe0e The wizard for creating new forms can be started via the ribbon, the keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl + N\" or also the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button. The same mechanisms can now be used to create new form fields within the wizard. Depending on the selected field type, other options are available in the field settings section. This will be clearly explained below using the example of the field type \"Password\". The sequence in which form fields are requested when creating new records corresponds to the sequence within the form. This can be adapted using the relevant buttons in the ribbon. The following field settings thus appear for the field type \"Password\": \"Mandatory field, reveal only with reason, check only generated passwords and password policy\". These can now be defined as desired. ( Note : It is possible to select password rules within the field settings; they are defined as part of the options in the main menu) Be Aware If a form has been created, it can then be selected for use when creating new records. The prerequisite is that the logged-in user has at least read rights to the form. Permissions for forms \u2693\ufe0e In the same way as for other objects (records, roles, documents,\u2026), permissions can also be granted for forms. On the one hand, this ensures that not everyone can edit existing forms, while on the other hand, it allows you to make forms available to selective groups. This ensures that clarity is maintained and that users are not confronted with information that is irrelevant to them. The form \"Credit cards\" may be relevant within the accounting department but administrators do not generally need to use it. Configuring the info field \u2693\ufe0e Every record displays other information underneath the obligatory name of the record in list view. In the following example, the user name is also displayed in addition to the name of the password. The name of the form is displayed in between in a blue font. The name of the record (192.168.150.236) and the form (password) cannot be adjusted \u2013 these are always displayed. The user (Administrator) that is still saved for the record is currently displayed. This can be configured in the info field for the form. It is thus possible to separately define for each form what information for a record can be directly seen in list view. In the form module, the info field is configured by opening the form which has to be edited in editing mode by double clicking on it and then pressing the *Configure info field\u201d button in the ribbon. This will open a separate tab that enables you to design the info section via drag & drop. The fields that are available on the right can be \"dragged\" onto the configuration window on the left. In the following example, \"Start RDP session2 will be made visible in the info section, whereby only the word \"RDP\" is assigned a function \u2013 namely to start the RDP manager. A preview is shown in the top section. The info field for the form is now updated. It is now possible to start the RDP session directly in the RDP session.

Move : Moves the record marked in list view to another organizational structure. Favorite : The selected record is marked as a favorite. It is possible to switch between all records and favorites at any time. Quick view : A modal window opens for the selected record for 15 seconds and displays all available information including the value of the password . Change form : It is possible to change the form used for individual records. \"Mapping\" of the previous form fields can be directly carried out in the process. Permissions \u2693\ufe0e Permissions : The drop-down menu can be used to set both password permissions and also form field permissions.

Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it!

Be Aware If a predefined rights exists, this will always overwrite inherited permissions from organizational structures Inherit permissions for new objects (without rights template) This setting is relevant for newly created records. The following values can be configured: Off: Permissions from OUs are not inherited Organizational unit: When creating new objects, permissions are set in accordance with the defined rights for the target organizational unit. This setting is active by default. Organizational unit and user: As well as inheriting permissions for organization units, the configured permissions for the user are now also inherited when creating private records. *If inheritance for the users is also activated, the creation of private records is in itself no longer possible. When creating new records to be saved in the organizational unit for the logged-in user, the permissions for the record are now granted in accordance with the permissions for the user. Existing passwords inherit changes to the permissions for organizational units This option means that changes to permissions for an organizational unit will be inherited by all passwords for this organizational unit. This setting is active by default. When inheriting permissions, a dialogue will be displayed that offers you the following options: Increase or reduce permissions: The permissions for the passwords are retained and are only increased or reduced by the change. Overwrite permissions: The permissions for the passwords are completely overwritten. This means that all permissions for a password are firstly removed and then the new permissions for the organizational unit are inherited. Cancel inheritance: The permissions are not inherited but are only changed in the organizational unit. *The permissions are only inherited by existing passwords within the organizational unit. Therefore, the permissions are not inherited downwards throughout the entire structure.

It can be configured in more detail using two settings. Be Aware If a predefined rights exists, this will always overwrite inherited permissions from organizational structures Inherit permissions for new objects (without rights template) This setting is relevant for newly created records. The following values can be configured: Off: Permissions from OUs are not inherited Organizational unit: When creating new objects, permissions are set in accordance with the defined rights for the target organizational unit. This setting is active by default. Organizational unit and user: As well as inheriting permissions for organization units, the configured permissions for the user are now also inherited when creating private records. *If inheritance for the users is also activated, the creation of private records is in itself no longer possible. When creating new records to be saved in the organizational unit for the logged-in user, the permissions for the record are now granted in accordance with the permissions for the user. Existing passwords inherit changes to the permissions for organizational units This option means that changes to permissions for an organizational unit will be inherited by all passwords for this organizational unit. This setting is active by default. When inheriting permissions, a dialogue will be displayed that offers you the following options: Increase or reduce permissions: The permissions for the passwords are retained and are only increased or reduced by the change. Overwrite permissions: The permissions for the passwords are completely overwritten. This means that all permissions for a password are firstly removed and then the new permissions for the organizational unit are inherited. Cancel inheritance: The permissions are not inherited but are only changed in the organizational unit. *The permissions are only inherited by existing passwords within the organizational unit. Therefore, the permissions are not inherited downwards throughout the entire structure. Example case This example shows the creation of a new record in the organizational structure \u201cmarketing\u201d. It is defined in the settings for the stated organizational structure that permissions should be inherited by new objects in accordance with the organizational structure.

This method of setting permissions is thus carried out separately for every record \u2013 this process is not as recommended for newly created data. If you want to work effectively in the long term, the automatic setting of permissions should be used. However, the manual setting of permissions is generally used when editing already existing records. Adding additional users with permissions \u2693\ufe0e In the previous section, it was clarified that permissions are granted either directly to the user or to several users grouped in a role. With this knowledge, the permissions can be set manually. In the \"Passwords\" module , there are three different ways to access the permissions in the list view: Icon in the ribbon Context menu of a data record (right-click) Icon at the right edge of the reading pane Note The icon on the right of the reading pane shows the information whether the record is personal or public. In case of personal data records, the user that is logged on is the only one who has permissions! The author is created with all permissions for the record. As described in the Permission Concept , you can now add roles and users. 'Right click - Add' inside the userlist or use the ribbon \"User and roles\" to add a user. The filter helps you to quickly find those users who should be granted permissions for the record in just a few steps. The search filter opens in a separate tab and can be configured as usual. Multiple selection is also enabled. It allows to add several users via the Windows standard Ctrl/Shift + left mouse button. Set and remove permissions \u2693\ufe0e By default, all added users or roles receive only the \u201cRead\u201d permission on the record. The \u201cRead\u201d permission at the beginning is sufficient to view the fields of the data record and to use the password. \"Write\" permission allows you to edit a data record. The permission \u201cAuthorize\u201d is necessary to authorize other users to the record . This is also a requirement for the configuration of a seal . Transferring permissions \u2693\ufe0e A simple right-click on a user can be used to copy and transfer permission configurations of users or roles to others in the context menu. In this context, the use of permission templates is also very practical. In the \u201cTemplate\u201d area of \u200b\u200bthe ribbon, you can save configured permissions, including all users, and reuse them for other records.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template. Seal templates can be optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview. Summary \u2693\ufe0e The permissions already present on the data set form the basis for any complex seal configurations. It is freely definable which users have to go through a release mechanism before accessing the password. The roles, which may be granted, are freely definable.

Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default.

The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record!

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates.

It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active.

A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information.
